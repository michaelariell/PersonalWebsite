            BaiturrahmanGrand Mosque in Aceh. This mosque is a relic of the Kingdom of Aceh which is a symbol of religion, culture, and the struggle of the people.
This is because the Baiturrahman mosque is not only a center of religious activities and a witness to the glory of the Aceh Kingdom, but has also been used as a defense base against attacks by the invaders.
The Baiturrahman Grand Mosque was built by Sultan Iskandar Muda, the king of Aceh from 1607-1636, in 1612 AD.
Historically, this mosque was burned by the Dutch, and survived when hit by the 2004 tsunami.
Several historical sources say that the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque was founded in 1612, during the Kingdom of Aceh was ruled by Sultan Iskandar Muda (1607-1636 AD).
However, there are also those who believe that this mosque was built earlier, namely by Sultan Alaidin Mahmudsyah in 1292.

            The Aceh Museum is a place not to be missed when stopping in Banda Aceh. Located on Jalan Alauddin Mahmud Syah, Banda Aceh, this museum stores various knick-knacks from the history of the Acehnese people since the prehistoric era. Here we can find various types of tools, agricultural equipment, household appliances, traditional weapons and traditional clothes. In this museum we can also find various collections of ancient manuscripts, historical photo documentation and mockups of the development of the Baiturrahman Great Mosque.
            This museum was founded during the reign of the Dutch East Indies. The inauguration was carried out on July 31, 1915, by the Civil and Military Governor of Aceh, General HNA Swart. This museum is headed by FW Stammeshaus who served as Head of the Museum as well as Curator until 1931. At that time, the museum was only in the form of a traditional Acehnese house (Rumoh Aceh) whose existence is still maintained in the museum courtyard area to this day. This wooden-based building is in the form of a stilt house with a peg construction system that can be disassembled flexibly.

            The Gunongan building or gegunongan jewel tower is the main building that composes the park as a whole. This building is a replica of a three-storey mountain with the top part of a tower-shaped terrace. The main element of the mention of Gunongan in this building is the curved shapes imitating the multi-layered topography of the mountain. At the top of the mountain there is an ornament in the form of petaled pearls. Each corner of the building is equipped with a kind of altar decorated with blooming flowers with pointed leaves. The entrance is on the south side, the threshold is very low so if we want to enter it must be in a bent position. Philosophically this is intended as an expression of respect (which is done with a bowed attitude) when you want to enter a place or visit. This door used to be called a cave with a silver cup door.
            Gunongan is a building with a ten-angle floor plan with a circle size of 46.45 m with a building wall thickness of 178 cm. Meanwhile, the second floor plan also has ten angles with a circle size of 24.66 m. On the second floor there is a hallway that encircles the walls of the second-story building which is 180 cm thick. The 110 cm wide tiled is mostly ground floor overgrown with grass. To get to the top, this building is equipped with narrow and steep stairs. The tower measuring 7.14 m in circumference is in the form of towering flower petals. The Gunongan building is made of mountain stones which are glued together specifically in the form of a mixture of clay and lime, the overall height of the building is 9.86 meters.
